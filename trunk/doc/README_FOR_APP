See Installation_notes.rtf for help on getting your environment up and running.

Testing Note: To get the Flex integration tests working, you'll need to do a test build (rake build:test).
You'll also need to have a separate process running on the same box configured as a test environment
when you run the tests.  Then run the rake test:flex task.
